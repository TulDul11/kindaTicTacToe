Two Tic-Tac-Toe's

AISimple.py only utilizes if's to decide whether to take moves or not.
AIHard.py requires AIData.py to be ran beforehand. AIHard.py uses an AI model to run (although quite unnecesary)
MP.py is the multiplayer version (instead of Player vs AI). It's not online.

It kind of works. Probably has some issues.
